# Configuration

There are a few options that you can configure in Packager. However, it's important to know that there are 2 types of options - `Packager Options` and `Bundle Options`.

`Packager Options` are options which you set on an instance of Packager and these cannot be overwritten.

`Bundle Options` are options which you set when you are bundling your files and these indeed can be overwritten with subsequent builds.

## Packager Options

```ts
type PackagerOptions = {
    cache: boolean;
    sourcemaps: boolean;
};
```

Package Options need to be registered on an instance of Packager like this:

```js
const packagerOptions = {};

const packager = new Packager(packagerOptions);
```

#### cache

Turning off cache doesn't give you any benefits so it's safe to leave it as `true` and in return, it will give you faster builds.

<ApiProps type="boolean" defaultValue="true" showUsage={false} />

#### sourcemaps

Sourcemaps allow you to show the code in the browser as it was when entering bundling process. It maintains the original look of the file by inlining a sourcemap per file.

<ApiProps type="boolean" defaultValue="false" showUsage={false} />
<Note>
    Sourcemaps are inlined so when you enable this option, it will greatly
    increase the size of your bundle.
</Note>

## Bundle Options

```ts
type File = {
    name: string;
    path: string;
    code: string;
    entry?: boolean;
};

type BundleOptions = {
    dependencies: { [moduleId: string]: string };
};
```

Bundle Options need to be registered when bundling files like this:

```js
const files: File[] = [
    {
        name: "app.js",
        path: "/src/app.js",
        code: `console.log('hello world!');`,
        entry: true
    }
];
const bundleOptions: BundleOptions = {};

const packager = new Packager();

packager.bundle(files, bundleOptions);
```

#### dependencies

By default, when Packager recognises an imported NPM module, it will fetch the latest version of that module.  
If you want to have control over this, `dependencies` is a Object with module name as keys and version as values.

<ApiProps type="{ [moduleId: string]: string }" defaultValue="{}" />

```js usage=true
const packager = new Packager();
const files = [];
const bundleOptions = {
    dependencies: {
        vue: "2.6.10",
        react: "16.11.0"
    }
};

packager.bundle(files, bundleOptions);
```
