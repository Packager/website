Some of the things which are planned to be released/worked on in the near future:

- More libraries supported such as pug, mdx, nunjucks and many more.
- Better support for Node environments
- CLI?

Have some ideas of your own? Create a Github issue on [Packager](https://github.com/baryla/packager) and let's make them happen :)
