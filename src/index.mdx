**Packager** is a browser-based trans-bundler which uses [Rollup's JavaScript API](https://rollupjs.org/guide/en/#javascript-api) under the hood to leverage the powerful plugin hooks, primarily `resolveId`, `load` and `transform`.

Although it's very powerful and capable of a lot of things, it's still in the early stages of development so if you want to sleep well at night, it's probably a good idea not to use it in production yet or any valuable project.

# Getting Started

Getting started with Packager is super easy. ðŸ‘‡

## Installation

If you want to start using it in your project by installing it through your favourite package manager, you can do it with:

```bash
$ yarn add packager
# or...
$ npm install packager
```

Alternatively, you can just add a script tag with a link to a CDN to use Packager :)

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/packager"></script>
```

## Usage

Once you have Packager installed, you can go ahead and use it like this:

```js
const packager = new Packager(packagerOptions);
await packager.bundle(files);
```

For more information about `packagerOptions` and `files`, head over to [Configuration](/configuration) and [API Reference](/api-reference).
